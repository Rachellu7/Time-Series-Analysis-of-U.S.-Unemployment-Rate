# Time-Series-Analysis-of-U.S.-Unemployment-Rate
An in-course project for STA450 Time Series: Applied R programming (astsa package) to integrate time series data of monthly employment rate in the U.S.
from 1948 to 2016, facilitating data manipulation and quantitative analysis stages. Performed residual diagnostics for two proposed seasonal ARIMA models to implement a further forecast of the unemployment
rate of the next ten months. Identified the underlying trend, conducted spatial analysis, and formed the final report using LaTeX.
